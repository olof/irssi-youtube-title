0.21:
  * whoa, fucked up bug. 
    http://www.youtube.com/watch?hl=en&v=tqZiY2RdoO4&gl=US 
    was posted to a channel, and my script got fucked up. 
    it printed the title of the video ~5 times a second, 
    until i checked irssi and had to kill the whole client.
    	Anyways, it could have to do with the weird order 
    of the query string, which is not to say that it's not 
    my fault - 1. i should handle it, and 2. i should not 
    fuck up irssi. What I did wrong was to check for one 
    regexp, and when found remove another regexp - i should 
    have deleted the same regexp, which i do now. 

0.2:
  * regexp didn't match all youtube videos. if you have a 
    variable in the query string before the v, it will not 
    find it. And i also found out that all vs isn't 11 
    characters.
